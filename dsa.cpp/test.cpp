//Problem Statement

//The town library has opened up a new students section. From the students section shelf, a student can pick up a certain number of consecutive books at small cost.



// Jeremy is a sincere student who wants to pick up the given number of books with smallest average price, so it doesn't put much burden on his pocket. You need to help him get the set of consecutive books which fulfil that criteria.

// Input Format

// The first line of input is an integer n, denoting the number of books kept in the students section.

// The second line of input is an integer max_book_count, denoting the number of consecutive books Jeremy can pick out of the students section

// shelf. The third line of input contains n space separated integers P1, P2. Pn. each denoting the price of books.

// Constraints

// 1 <=n<= 100000

// 1 <= max_book_count <= 50000

// 1 <= p <= 1000000 for all 1 <= i<=n

// Output Format

// The output will have two consective lines, each containing one integer each.

// The first line of output will be the beginning index (0 based) of the picked set of books from the students section shelf.

// The second line of output will be the ending index (0 based) of the picked set of books from the students section shelf.
